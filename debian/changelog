nadybot (5.3.0-1+ubuntu1) bionic; urgency=medium
  Bugfixes:
  - Fix discord relay sometimes not showing the name of the
    person saying something on Discord
  - Fix a race condition where quickly banning and unbanning an org
    resulted in an error.
  - Race condition for the shared online list fixed, which lead to players
    shown as online when they already logged off
  - Fixed tyrbot() protocol errors when relaying only with a prefix
  - Fix genRandomString() from sometimes returning less chars than requested
    This also fixes Sec-WebSocket-Key from being non-standard sometimes
  - Make websockets more robust, testing against autobahn testsuite
  - Don't try to relay messages to uninitialized arrays
  - Highway didn't properly deinit its relay stack, leading to
    lingering websocket connections.
  - PHP8 fix when "!orglist" had an unused org rank
  - Tower attacks should now always be assigned to the correct tower field
    by using boundary boxes from Tyrbot
  - Commands longer than 20 chars won't throw errors in the usage module anymore
  - A fake attacker will now show up properly in "!attacks"
  - "!sites" now considers local scout data to be newer than API data
  - Don't treat mute/unmute and deafen/undeafen as joining a Discord channel
  - When sharing database with other bots, don't share their online lists
    via relays
  - Discord reconnects won't forget the channels anymore
    This will prevent the bot from stopping to relay from discord after a reconnect.
  - Fix a rare condition where the event loop would just hang and throw errors
  - To help 32bit systems, convert some Discord data types from int to string
  - Fix setting the bot's timezone with "!timezone"
  - Now all syntax variants of the SPIRITS_MODULE work as expected
  - Running "!whatbuffsfroob <slot>" no longer throws an exception
  - Running "!arulsaba <type> 6 left" no longer throws an exception
  - Running "!lookup <uid>" will now run an actual lookup and display the data
  - !hot command honors first argument again
  - !test commands work again as expected
  - Fixed race condition of the orglist test
  - sync-online=false now behaves as expected for nadynative()
    It will still route online events when you route org- and private
    channels to the relay. Filter these events if you don't want that.
  - Convert all Aria tables to InnoDB as it doesn't support
    transactions.
  - Fix displaying of route modifiers with <, > or "
  - Fix the if-matches() modifier

    new non-null columns to the database without default

  - Fixed some errors in the tracker and orglist module
  - Fix migration of tower data from pre-5.2.2 release

  Features:
  - New WORLDBOSS_MODULE to track tara, vizaresh, etc. as well
    as the gauntlet buff. This obsolete's the old external
    GAUNTLET_MODULE and BIGBOSS_MODULE. The old "!bb" is now "!wb"
  - Add an option to group the online list by faction
  - New command "!loglevel" to temporary change the loglevel
  - New command "!debug" to debug a single command and upload the logs
  - Lots of logging added for better debugging
  - Nadybot will now automatically receive events like world bosses spawning
    or Gauntlet buffs being popped and set the timers accordingly.
    This is done by connecting to the public highway server and joining a
    room that sends these events. Option can be turned off in the RELAY_MODULE
  - Automatically fetch the current worldboss and gauntlet timers
    from our API when connecting. No more need for manual timers.
  - Add option to autokick players not in the raid on raid lock
  - Speed up the "!orglist" command by skipping the UID lookup and
    instead using the UID the org roster contains
  - Show channel class in "!system"
  - Add "!db3" command to show DB3 loot
  - Merge the IMPQL_MODULE into the IMPLANT_MODULE
  - Make the rank required to cancel another player's raffle a setting
  - Add ability to define immutable values for any setting in the config file
  - Add separate kill message when using worldboss kill or kill sync
  - Add raid statistics to "!leaders" command
  - Display event descriptions with "!relay config" command
  - Non-routable events can now be relayed via supporting protocols
    (currently only nadynative). Non-routable events are a special
    type of event that are shared via nadynative relays. These
    include tower scouting, tara spawn, timers, countdown, etc.
  - New command "!raid notinkick" to kick every character on the
    private channel who's not in the raid.
  - New event modifier "change-message()" that allows you to modify
    messages with prefixes (like @here) and search & replace
  - New customizable "news" page that can be shown on login. This
    one can be made up from individual "tiles", so you have a single
    start/welcome message displaying multiple tiles, like gauntlet
    buff, current arbiter, actual unread news, tara spawn, etc.
    The content of this page can be customized with "!startpage"

  Other:
  - Upgraded all required packages to latest version and resolved issues
  - Replaced the logging framework from log4php with monolog
  - Added missing table indices
  - Switched to the new history API
  - Reduce tracker SQL queries to speed up "!orglist" for large orgs
  - Sort the "!track online" characters by name in their group
  - Removed "!lc import"
  - Users tracked via "!track addorg" don't show on "!track" anymore

  - Also explain that postgresql is a valid database type
  - Fix all possible undefined and type errors by utilizing
    2 static code analyzers phpstan and psalm
  - Upgrade to latest illuminate/database version
  - Convert all text files from DOS to UNIX line ending
  - Reword the SKILL_MODULE help files
  - Add loads of parameter classes for things like implant slots, items or faction

  - "!trickle <skill>" output changed so it's easier to understand
  - Remove PvP rank from "!whois" as it's a fixed value
  - Support relay events properly via the API
  - Allow dynamically added events to have a description
  - Support custom setting handlers with new "@SettingHandler()"
    annotation. This allows modules to have their own custom setting
    types.
  - Group subcommands below their commands in "!config"
  - The alignment in tower pop-up messages is now colorized
  - New syntax for writing commands
    The old way was to write a function and declare the command
    it was for and a regular expression that needs to match for this
    function to be used. Then the function was given 5 well-defined
    arguments, so you could not easily add new parameters to those.
    The new way just gives one parameter, a CmdContext instance that
    contains everything the old parameters had, but is more extensible.
    You also no longer define a regular expression that needs to match,
    but give the parameters your command needs as additional parameters
    to your function.
    The old syntax will still be supported until at least 7.0 release.
    See the WIKI for details.

  Features:
  - Complete relay stack rewrite:
    * Allow any number of relays, each with its own prefix, protocol,
      transport, etc. You can use any protocol with any transport
      (Tyrbot via AMQP, BeBot via Websocket, etc.)
    * Support BeBot's relay protocol
    * Support Tyrbot's relay protocol
    * Integrate agcr protocol from ALLIANCE_RELAY_MODULE
    * Add new native relay protocol for Nadybot
    * Support custom relay-stack layers. Built-in are:
      * encryption, relaying over websockets and sharing online lists
  - Complete messaging rewrite, introducing the message hub:
    * Allows routing messages from any supported channel to another channel
    * Supports wildcards as channel source
    * Supports custom modifiers. Built-in are:
      * if-has-prefix(), remove-popups(), if-matches(), if-not-by() and many more
    * Allow setting if and how a tag is displayed for each of the
      hops a message passes
    * Allow configuring the color of each of the tags and texts rendered,
      depending on source and target hop. This allows for custom colors
      for private channel, web chat, console...
  - New security module that lets you configure to log security-relevant
    events and makes them available via !audit command and API calls
  - API endpoint /org/history to complement the audit API
  - Support for signed API calls, so pure API-calls don't need to
    re-authenticate once per hour.

    and into the webchat. Yes, even Darknet, relays and discord... everything
  - API spec is now tagged for better overview

  Bugfixes:

  - Rendering certain popups in Discord looked wrong (e.g. !alts)

    see if all required modules are present. Bot will now check for this and
    give you a meaningful error-message
  - Since routing is done by name now, changing your discord channel name
    can break your routing.
