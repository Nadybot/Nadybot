# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- You can now sync bans and unbans via nadynative
- When changing the message that should be send to Discord whenever your own towers are being attacked, the bot will now warn if there is no route in place to actually make use of this message.
- Add a link to bank browse- and search-results to ask the bank character to give you a specific item, including its location.

### Changed

- The default discord notification for own towers being attack has been change to off.
- You can no longer create Discord invites with `!discord join` if your account is already linked.

### Fix

- Add back the "loot" and "auction" links to loot lists

## [6.0.4] - 2022-06-05

### Added

- Allow specifying the ql or ql-range to search for when using `!bank search`

### Fix

- The `TrackerFormatHandler` was moved to its correct namespace.
- The nadybot-big image works again as expected.
- Fix `!orglist` for RK19

## [6.0.3] - 2022-05-27

### Added

- New setting `add_header_ranges`. If enabled, in addition to Page X/Y, it will print the (sub-)header-ranges in that page (ADMIN -> TOWER_MODULE) as well, if the page is streuctured like that
- Add support for Discord Slash-commands. The setting `discord_slash_commands` determines if they are disabled, only visible to the person sending them, or treated like a regular command and routed from/to the bot-channels.
  Because Discord allows a maximum of 100 global slash-commands, you have to use `!discord slash add|rem|pick` to configure which commands will be exposed. By default, some are exposed already that most people will probably want to, but this won't apply to everyone.
- The name of every access-level-rank can now be changed freely.
- The `!leaders`-command can now be configured to also show the admins and mods.
- The colors that `!online` displays for ranks raid_leader and upwards, are now customizable.
- Make "on"- and "off"-colors a configurable setting in the `COLORS` module
- Add settings to configure the colors of `!tell`, `!cmd` and `!topic`.
- Allow banning orgs without giving a reason

### Changed

- The `!track online`-command got a real parser now and supports filtering by level (ranges), title level (ranges), faction(s) and profession(s).
- The message that's displayed when a tracked character goes on/offline is now completely configurable with {placeholders}. To display this properly, a new setting type `tracker_format` has been introduced that will display rendered and unrendered versions of the setting. There is also logic to remove `{org}` from the message is the character is not member of an org.
- Gracefully support URLs for bank-CSV location. Download will be async with proper error handling.
- Raid ranks in online-list are also shown for access-level "guild".
- Joining and leaving voice chats will now display the linked AO character, if available.
- Change the default "disabled/off"-color to a slightly lighter shade of red.

### Fix

- Due to a logic error, once a websocket connection timed out, chances were, it would constantly timeout again.
- `!events setdate <id> <date>` now understands a lot more date-formats.
- Browsing bank backpacks accidentally showed each backpack as often as items were in the backpack.
- Fix a non-critical error-message when running `!lc <tower site>` which would have turned into a hard error in PHP 8.2

## [6.0.2] - 2022-05-10

### Added

- Add a new property to raids, that allows to limit the maximum number of raiders. Can be set with either `!raid start <description> limit <max members>` or `!raid limit <max members>`.
- New command `!orgnote` to manage org-wide notes that can also be shared via Nadynative protocol.
- New Docker image `nadybot-big` which includes the AOChatProxy, so only 1 container is needed to run bots with more than 1000 members.
- New command `members inactive` to list members who haven't logged in for a given amount of time.
- `!adminlist` now shows the last time the bot has seen each admin and on which alt.
- Add new option `--strict` to make SQLite checks more strict. This is mainly for development purpose.
- Add new prometheus metric `states{type="raid_lock"}`
- The `LOOT_MODULE` now keeps a full history of what was rolled when, and who won what on which roll. You can search this history by using `!loot history`, `!loot history <number>|last`, `!loot search winner=Nady` and `!loot search item=leg`.
- All Docker images now support setting fixed settings via setting environment variables `CONFIG_SETTING_<setting>=<value>`, e.g. `CONFIG_SETTING_CONSOLE_COLOR=1`
- New commands `!config setting <name>` and `!config setting <name> admin <access level>` to change the required access level to change a setting's value.
- Add new setting `raid_reward_requires_lock` to control if giving points via `!raid reward`/`!raid punish` requires the raid to be lock with `!raid lock`.
- The Docker image now supports setting multiple superadmins, either separated by comma, space or both. so `CONFIG_SUPERADMIN=Nady,Nadyita` and `CONFIG_SUPERADMIN="Nady Nadyita, Nadyo"` both work.

### Changed

- The `!discord`-command got completely changed. It now acts as the central command to manage the discord connection, manage Discord invites, see invites and leave Discord servers. To get people a Discord link, just have them `!discord join` and click the link, the bot will automatically rename the Discord user to match the main AO character and optionally also assign one or more Discord roles.
- Add a new command `!assist random <number>` to pick `<number>` random callers from the currently running raid. You can exclude professions from this random pick by changing the `never_auto_callers` setting, default excludes docs and crats.
- `!raid punish` now also accepts the name of a pre-defined reward, analogue to `!raid reward`.
- The loglevel of handlers used to always be ignored and scaled with the configuration option of channels. This has been changed so that the new log level "default" will now automatically scale, while explicitly given ones like "error" will always stay on error. This allows you to log error output into separate files.
- Retries for 502 Http results are now delayed by 5s, in order not to hammer the webserver
- The `!member`-command is now a sub-command of `!members`, so `!members add <who>` now works the same as `!member add`. Access levels are migrated.
- If audits are enabled (`!settings save audit_enabled 1`), `!whois <name>` will now show information from the audit when and by whom the person was added to the bot.
- `!auction` is now an alias of `!bid`. The former was removed, because the command `!auction` was originally only added to have separate access levels for auctioneers and bidders and I didn't expect anyone to use `!auction start` over the alias `!bid start` and so on.
- If no log files are available (Docker), don't show an empty popup.
- Logging in Docker is now the same format as logfiles - not like console.
- Locking the private channel is now persistent across bot restarts.
- Location of the `text.mdb`-file was changed from `data/` to `res/`, so it doesn't collide with user data and makes it easier for containers to just mount a generic data-folder into `/nadybot/data`.
- When configured to use a proxy, don't exit when the proxy isn't reachable, but retry until it is. This fixes cases when the chat proxy has lots of workers and takes longer to accept connection than Nadybot to start to connect.

### Fixed

- Fix `/api/access_levels` endpoint and make settings webfrontend work again.
- Fix for `!raid reward <points> <reason>` and `!raid punish <points> <reason>`. They both work again as expected.
- Detect if the Discord Cloudflare server restart and also do an automatic reconnect in that case. In fact, make automatic reconnect the default, unless manually disconnected.
- Websocket timeout detection works properly now and Discord should automatically reconnect after connection is lost.

### Security

- Add new settings `webserver_min_al` to specify the overall required min access level for interacting with the bot via API or WebUI. Before this, using aoauth authentication would allow you to read the chat via the WebUI, because this target did not have a defined minimum access level.

## [6.0.1] - 2022-04-24

### Added

- Allow hiding arbitrary characters from the online list, so you don't see other orgs' bots or can even hide their whole guest channel.
- Support openSUSE tumbleweed packages
- Warn when the buddylist is full
- Add `system(mass-message)` and `system(mass-invite)` as route destinations, so you can finally route your tara/reaper spawns directly to mass invites.

### Fixed

- Fix database creation from scratch

### Security

- Fix `GHSA-x7cr-6qr6-2hh6` / `CVE-2022-24828` vulnerability

## [6.0.0] - 2022-04-19

### Changed

- Updated .deb and .rpm build instructions

## [6.0.0-rc.2] - 2022-04-12

### Added

- Nadybot now supports color-themes and ships with 16 of these to make customizing your bot even easier. Just try `!themes`

### Changed

- Failure to initiate an SSL-connection will now be retried automatically.
- Bots with AO Chat Proxies will now wait longer before they mark themselves ready. This solves some issues with long buddylists.
- Add retries to the worldboss and Gauntlet buff APIs
- Querying the buddylist if a buddy is online will not trigger a UID-lookup anymore. If you are tracking whole orgs with lots of inactive characters, then the `!track online` could hang and even crash the bot.

## [6.0.0-rc.1] - 2022-04-07

### Added

- Defining the colors for relays is now possible directly in the `!relay`-window, including examples what the current config looks like.
- Use the GMP module (if installed) for a faster login

### Changed

- Replaced the 'discord_notify_voice_changes'-setting with routes. All Discord voice-channels now appear as routing sources with a `<` before their name. Routing `discordpriv(<*)` will now route the online/offline-events of all discord-channels, or only a selected few.

## [6.0.0-beta.2] - 2022-04-01

### Added

- Allow adding settings via Attributes
- New 'timestamp' setting type

### Changed

- Database table versions are displayed with a date and time (if possible)
- Changed all module settings to use attributes (if possible)
- Text settings with empty strings are now marked as &lt;empty&gt;
- Mass-messages and -invites are now a system route source. By default, `system(mass-message)` and `system(mass-invite)` will be routed to `aoorg` and `aopriv`, but you can also route them to Discord.
- All messages from the RAID_MODULE are no longer hardcoded to being sent to the bot's private channel. Instead, there are now a bunch of new routing sources `raid(*)` and `auction(*)` which are routed to `aopriv` by default. This allows for routing of `raid(start)` or `raid(points-modified)` to Discord channels.

### Removed

- Removed unused setting "Show icons for the nanolines"

### Fixed

- The deduplication-handler for logging should no longer run out of memory
- The "Show test results" setting once again has an effect
- The "Confirmed news count for all alts" setting now works again
- Routing `spawn(gauntlet-*)`-messages works again

## [6.0.0-beta.1] - 2022-03-22

### Added

- Add `!buddylist rebalance` to rebalance your buddies across your proxies

## [6.0.0-alpha.2] - 2022-03-12

### Added

- Allow grouping of `!track online` lists by faction, org, gender and breed

### Changed

- Automatically retry timed out get-requests up to 5 times, without logging an error.
- Download the orglists via the cache-module, so we speed them up and remove some needless strain from the Funcom servers.

### Fixed

- Make the cache work on docker again
- The default setting was ignored and the last option was always chosen

## [6.0.0-alpha.1] - 2022-03-08

### Changed

- Check extra modules for compile errors and compatibility with this bot version before loading. Treat `<X.0.0` as `<X.0.0-0` to work around a bug.
- Adding settings now requires "options" to be an array, not a string, plus there are no more "intoptions". If you need "intoptions", use an associative array for "options".
- Moved from PHPDoc annotations to PHP 8 attributes, greatly increasing parsing speed
- Change the start-up banner to be more concise
- Change a lot of the default permissions that were using "all" or "member" to "guest"
- Remove all global variables
- Sub-commands are no longer regular expressions, but rather user-friendly names.
  Sub-commands are only used to group permissions now and can be chosen freely.
  All existing sub-command-rights are being migrated automatically
- Replace the huge banner with a smaller one for N6
- Help for commands is now created from the source file and no longer from separate help files. A new `!help syntax` explains the syntax and is linked to from every help page, unless turned off.
- The `!help` command is now a central landing page for getting help and no longer a list of commands
- Moved `!adminhelp` from guides to help, so it's part of core
- Instead of having 3 fixed "channels", there is now an unlimited number of permission sets. By default, they have the same names as the old channels and the same short letter symbols (T|G|P). These permission sets can be managed with the `!permset` command and mapped to a command source via the `!cmdmap` command. The command prefix is now also part of this mapping, so you can have different prefixes for org, private chat, discord and so on.
- After authenticating, the socket to the AO chat server is now non-blocking.
  That also means that AO-packets aren't prioritized higher than others anymore.
  In the past, if one packet was ready to be read, *all* of he packets would be read in one go. This is no longer the case.
- Migrations are no longer executed manually during setup, but automatically when registered with #[HasMigrations]. The order in which they are executed is now predictable and strictly timed.
- No module accesses another module's database tables directly anymore, only via exposed functions from the other module
- The configuration is now parsed into an instanced object (ConfigFile), that can be injected, instead of using a global variable `$vars`
- Where it makes sense, function calls have been converted from positional to by-name
- The #[Inject]/@Inject annotation used to determine the name of the instance to inject by the variable name. This has been changed to the class name. Thus, it is no longer possible to inject into untyped properties.
  Example: `DB $database` will now inject the "db" instance, not the "database".
- The way commands have to be declared has completely changed
- Everything is now constantly checked against psalm and phpstan

### Added

- Allow having more than 1 superadmin
- Add a Prometheus-compatible metrics-endpoint to /metrics
- New command `!showconfig` to get your current configuration, minus sensitive data
- The console is now reporting in as a source, so you can actually use it for chatting. In order to do that, you should not make the command prefix optional.
- Introduce a new access level "guest" for people in the private chat or Discord chat
- Modules can now register themselves as AccessLevelProvider, so modules can manage their own access levels. The highest one (lowest numeric) will always be chosen.
- The (sub-)command declaration can now define multiple aliases at once
- Officially support Windows
- Allow increased logging with -v and -v -v

### Removed

- Sync name-lookups from PORK are gone
- Remove all deprecated DB calls (query, queryRow, etc.)
- You can no longer inject into untyped properties
- Command help files are no more
- The old `/** @ */` annotations are no more, please use attributes
- The old command-syntax with a fixed amount of parameters is gone
- PHP 7 is no longer supported

- Allow queuing of relay messages if the relay is down, so restarting a relay-bot won't lead to lost messages.

## [5.3.1] - 2021-12-19

### Fixed

- Fix a race condition in database migrations which would throw an error that the timers table didn't exist

## [5.3.0-alpha.2] - 2021-11-01

### Fixed

- Converting Gauntlet timer fixed
- `!boss` command renamed to `!wb`

## [5.3.0-alpha] - 2021-11-01

### Added

- New WORLDBOSS_MODULE to track Tarasque, Vizaresh, etc. as well as the gauntlet buff.
  This obsoletes the old external GAUNTLET_MODULE and BIGBOSS_MODULE
- Non-routable events can now be relayed via supporting protocols (currently only nadynative).
  Non-routable events are a special type of event that are shared via nadynative relays. These include tower scouting, tara spawn, timers, countdown, etc.
- New command `!raid notinkick` to kick every character on the private channel who's not in the raid.
- New event modifier `change-message()` that allows you to modify messages with prefixes (like @here) and search & replace
- New customizable "news" page that can be shown on login. This one can be made up from individual "tiles", so you have a single start/welcome message displaying multiple tiles, like gauntlet buff, current arbiter, actual unread news, tara spawn, etc.
  The content of this page can be customized with `!startpage`

### Fixed

- Convert all Aria tables to InnoDB as it doesn't support transactions.
- Fix displaying of route modifiers with `<`, `>` or `"`
- Fix the `if-matches()` modifier
- Allow the use of @here for people allowed to use mentions and messages from the bot itself
- Fix for old SQLite versions that do not support adding new non-null columns to the database without default
- Fix for discord roles with too many permissions
- Fixed some errors in the tracker and orglist module
- Fix migration of tower data from pre-5.2.2 release

### Changed

- Support custom setting handlers with new `@SettingHandler()` annotation. This allows modules to have their own custom setting types.
- Group sub-commands below their commands in `!config`
- The alignment in tower pop-up messages is now colorized
- New syntax for writing commands
  The old way was to write a function and declare the command it was for and a regular expression that needs to match for this function to be used. Then the function was given 5 well-defined arguments, so you could not easily add new parameters to those.
  The new way just gives one parameter, a CmdContext instance that contains everything the old parameters had, but is more extensible.
  You also no longer define a regular expression that needs to match, but give the parameters your command needs as additional parameters to your function.
  See the WIKI for details.

## [5.2.2] - 2021-10-20

### Added

- Rewritten tower module to support Tyrence's tower API as well as manual scouting and mixed mode.
- New commands `!lock`/`!unlock` to lock/unlock the private channel to a certain rank and upwards, so you can perform maintenance work
- Welcome messages: When a file `data/welcome.txt` exists, new members will get a tell with this in a pop-up. Used to welcome them, explain basic things like netiquette, rules, etc.
- Route colors now support the "via" clause. Colors can now be defined depending on which hop (e.g. relay) they pass
- The track module now allows tracking whole orgs with `!track addorg`
  Since this will also add their bots, you can now hide and unhide individual chars from the `!track online` list.

### Fixed

- The `!logs` command now works if you have them somewhere else than `./logs/`
- Rendering certain popups in Discord looked wrong (e.g. `!alts`)

### Changed

- When updating the bot via git, you also have to run `composer install` to see if all required modules are present. Bot will now check for this and give you a meaningful error-message
