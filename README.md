Nadybot is the next-generation chatbot for Anarchy Online.

It's the logical descendant from BudaBot 4.0 which is why the first release was called 5.0 instead of 1.0.

Please see the [GitHub Wiki page](https://github.com/Nadybot/Nadybot/wiki) for a complete wiki how to run and configure the bot.

Feel free to [download the latest releases](https://github.com/Nadybot/Nadybot/releases/latest) if you want to use it and let me know if you are having problems.
