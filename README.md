Nadybot is a next-generation chatbot for Anarchy Online.

We offer [installable packages for Linux](https://github.com/Nadybot/Nadybot/wiki/Packages) for those who want to run the bot. This is by far the easiest way.

For more information and documentation, please see the [GitHub Wiki page](https://github.com/Nadybot/Nadybot/wiki). It has everything you need to run and configure the bot.

If you just want the source, [download the bundle from the latest release](https://github.com/Nadybot/Nadybot/releases/latest).
