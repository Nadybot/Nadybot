To scout a tower site:
<highlight><tab><symbol>scout 'playfield' 'site number' 'paste ct blob info'<end>

For instance:
<highlight><tab><symbol>scout PW 4 Control Tower - Clan Level: 190 Danger level: Killing it poses no danger. Might attack you on sight. Alignment: clan  Organization: Dark Ninjas Created at UTC: 2014-05-19 12:34:56<end>

Note that the closing time is the "Created at" time, but only the time part, not the date part.

To remove a scouted tower site and mark it as unscouted:
<highlight><tab><symbol>remscout 'playfield' 'site number'<end>

To mark a tower site as unplanted:
<highlight><tab><symbol>scout 'playfield' 'site number' none<end>

To show a list of sites that need scouting:
<highlight><tab><symbol>needsscout<end>
