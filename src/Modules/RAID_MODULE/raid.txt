<header2>Basic raid commands<end>

In order to start a raid, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>raid start 'description'<end>

The raid will be started with some default settings you can find in the config page of this module.

Likewise, to stop a raid, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>raid stop<end>

Once a raid is running, players can <i><symbol>raid join</i> to enter. If you
want to prevent more people from joining, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>raid lock<end>
<tab><highlight><symbol>raid unlock<end>

to lock/unlock the raid. The raid leaders can still manually add players to the raid, but
not the players themselves. You can then issue a
<tab><highlight><symbol>raid notin<end>

in order to warn all those people in the private channel that haven't joined yet.

The reason to use the raid functionality is to easily check if everyone is with you,
by issuing a
<tab><highlight><symbol>raid check<end>

before you step. By carefully checking for 'Cannot find &gt;player&lt;', you
can easily spot who joined the raid but isn't here yet or was simply never
invited.

If you are running a point raid, points are given with
<tab><highlight><symbol>raid reward 'amount'<end>

to all members of the raid
