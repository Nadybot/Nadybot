In order to check if you are blocked from some raid aspects and for how long:
<tab><highlight><symbol>raidblock<end>

In order to temporarily block a player from attending aspects of the raids:
<tab><highlight><symbol>raidblock bid 'player' 'duration' 'reason'<end>
<tab><highlight><symbol>raidblock join 'player' 'duration' 'reason'<end>
<tab><highlight><symbol>raidblock points 'player' 'duration' 'reason'<end>

If you leave out the duration, the block is unlimited and needs to be manually lifted.

To lift a block:
<tab><highlight><symbol>raidblock rem 'player'<end>
<tab><highlight><symbol>raidblock rem 'player' 'bid/join/points'<end>

To check another player's blocks:
<tab><highlight><symbol>raidblock 'player'<end>
