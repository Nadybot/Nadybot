Players can get points only once for each reward,
no matter with how many characters they are in the
raid.

Setting this option to true only means that they cannot
bid and (if configured) join raffles on any alt that's
not in the raid, plus the alts not in the raid won't be
considered for <highlight><symbol>raid notin<end>.
