<header2>Running auctions<end>

To auction an item, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>bid start 'item'<end> or
<tab><highlight><symbol>auction start 'item'<end>

To cancel a running auction, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>bid cancel<end> or
<tab><highlight><symbol>auction cancel<end>

<header2>Misbidding<end>

To refund someone for an accidentally won auction, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>bid refund 'name'<end> or
<tab><highlight><symbol>auction refund 'name'<end>

This will refund 'name' for the last auction they have won.
It will usually not give them back the full amount, but subtract
a small "tax", as configured on the bot.

You cannot refund further back than the last auction 'name' has
won.

If you want custom refunds or refunds further back than the last
auction, take a look at the <highlight><symbol>points add<end> and <highlight><symbol>points rem<end> commands.
