To check what's the current mission from Arbiter Vincenzo Palmiero, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>arbiter<end>

To check which mission will be active at a future date/time, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>arbiter june 6th 2025<end>
<tab><highlight><symbol>arbiter next week<end>
<tab><highlight><symbol>arbiter saturday<end>

Once in a while, the arbiter takes a break and doesn't come to the ICC.
In that case, you can use
<tab><highlight><symbol>arbiter set bs<end>
<tab><highlight><symbol>arbiter set ai<end>
<tab><highlight><symbol>arbiter set dio<end>

to manually set that you are currently in one of those weeks.
All future calculations will then be adjusted accordingly.

When setting the arbiter week  on a Sunday, we don't know for sure which
Sunday this is - the first or the last day of the period.
By default, we will assume that this is the first Sunday of the
event, but you can add 'ends' to the commands like so:
<tab><highlight><symbol>arbiter set bs ends<end>
This will set that today is the last day of the PvP week.
