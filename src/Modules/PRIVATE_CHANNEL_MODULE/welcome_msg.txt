The welcome message is the text that is sent to new members
of the bot if a file data/welcome.txt exists.

The content of data/welcome.txt will be put into a popup and
the link to this popup is the "click me" in
&lt;link&gt;click me&lt;/link&gt;.

You are free to use the variable &lt;myname&gt;, which is the botname,
as well as any supported color like &lt;color&gt;text&lt;end&gt;, e.g.
&lt;green&gt;I am green&lt;end&gt; or &lt;highlight&gt;important&lt;end&gt;.
