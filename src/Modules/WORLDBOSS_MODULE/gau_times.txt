The <highlight>gaubuff_times<end> setting takes a list of budatime (see <a href='chatcmd:///tell <myname> help budatime'><symbol>help budatime</a>) values to indicate when Gauntlet buff alerts should be displayed.

For example: <highlight>30m 10m<end> (the default value) indicates that the alert for the first announcement is 30m before the Gauntlet buff runs out, then 10m before it runs out and finally when it expires.

The times must be valid budatime values and must be separated by a single space.
