When you use aoauth.org to authenticate your logins,
a successful authenticating will need to redirect you
back to your Nadybot webserver.
If you have any form of (reverse-)proxy in front of
your bot (e.g. for https), you need to provide the base
URL of your bot, so the redirect can go to this URL, plus
path and parameters.

If, for example, your bot's API is reachable as
<highlight>https://bot1.securedomain.org/web/api<end>

then set your base URL to
<highlight>https://bot1.securedomain.org/web<end>
