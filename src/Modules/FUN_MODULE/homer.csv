homer,"Well you know boys, a nuclear reactor is a lot like women. You just have to read the manual and press the right button. "
homer,"Well, crying isn't gonna bring him back ... unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back or you can go out there and find your dog."
homer,"Well, I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wanna be a league bowler!"
homer,"Well, it's like the time that your cat Snowball got run over? Remember that, honey? Well, what I'm saying is all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman. "
homer,"Well, let's just call them, uh, Mr. X and Mrs. Y. So anyway, Mr.X would say, 'Marge, if this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't ""Homer J. Simpson."""
homer,"Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup - it tastes like catsup. But brother, it ain't catsup!"
homer,"We're gonna get a new TV. Twenty-one inch screen, realistic flesh tones, and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays."
homer,"We're laughing with her, Marge. There's a big difference. Ha ha ha! ... with her. "
homer,"What are you gonna do? Sick your dogs on me? Or your bees? Or dogs with bees in their mouth so when they bark they shoot bees at me?"
homer,"What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts. "
homer,"What the hey, I'll take the job."
homer,"What's the point of going out, we're just going to end up back here anyway?"

homer,"When I look at the smiles on all the children's faces. Just know they're about to jab me with something."
homer,"When will I learn? The answer to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!"
homer,"Yeah Moe that team sure did suck last night. They just plain sucked! I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked! Oh, I gotta go, my damn weiner kids are listening."
homer,"Yes, honey ... Just squeeze your rage up into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time, like that day I hit the referee with the whiskey bottle."
homer,"Lisa, remember me as I am - filled with murderous rage. (y2k disaster)"
homer,"You couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine."
homer,"You know, Moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me. She said, `Homer, you're a big disappointment,' and God bless her soul, she was really onto something."

homer,"You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your gloomy music, they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I can't possibly provide."
homer,"You tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is 'never try'."
homer,"You'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel."
homer,"Your lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I, many of them incompetent boobs. I know this because I worked alongside them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say ... This stinks!"
homer,"Now son, you don't want to drink beer. That's for Daddys, and kids with fake IDs."

homer,"Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose : it's how drunk you get."
homer,"Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else - and it hasn't - it's that girls should stick to girls' sports, such as hot oil wrestling and foxy boxing and such and such."

homer,"Who is this? ... ugly nose ... liver spot ... liver spot ... liver spot ... liver spot ..."
homer,"Is it normal to see Mr.Burn's face on a bowling ball?"
homer,"I know what is going on here. They did it to Jesus. Now they are doing it to me.  Marge : Are you comparing yourself to our Lord?  Homer : Only in bowling ability."
homer,"Maggie, that was a perfect game. But you stepped a little over the line. So, I am taking off 5 points. ( Maggie at 295 in bowling )."

homer,"I should have paid attention to the side effects. It's all in here."
homer,"Now I prepare my soul for an eternity of fire and poking."
homer,"I am doing a walk-on. It is a show business thing. ( after bowling fame )."
homer,"I know someone holier than Jesus. ( Flanders )."
homer,"You can't depend on me all your life. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us."
homer,"The code of the schoolyard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see. Don't tattle. Always make fun of those different from you. Never say anything, unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do. What else ..."
homer,"And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned."
homer,"What? Those cute little monkeys? That's terrible. Who told you that? I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us? Who roller-skate and smoke cigars?"
homer,"And Lord, we are especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is. Except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. "

homer,"Well, you bought all those smoke alarms, and we haven't had a single fire. "

homer,"Bart : I am through with working. Working is for chumps.  Homer : Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out."
homer,"Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different."
homer,"Oh, Marge, cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh."
homer,"A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic, that would make me a criminal."

homer,"Rev. Lovejoy : So Homer, please feel free to tell us anything. There's no judgment here.  Homer : The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.  Rev. Lovejoy : I cast thee out!"
homer,"Homer [thinks] Don't tell him you were at a bar! Gasp! But what else is open at night? [aloud] It's a pornography store. I was buying pornography. [thinks] Heh heh heh. I would'a never thought of that."
homer,"God is teasing me! Just like he teased Moses in the desert!"

homer,"Wow. A baby and a free burger. Could this be the best day of my life?"
homer,"So I says, blue M&M, red M&M, they all wind up the same color in the end."
homer,"Homer : Hey boy! Wanna play catch?  Bart : No thanks dad.  Homer : When a son doesn't want to play catch with his father something is definitely wrong.  Grandpa : I'll play catch with you!  Homer : Go home."

homer,"Marge that's twice - I think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman."
homer,"Homer : Here's your giraffe little girl.  Ralph : I'm a boy.  Homer : That's the spirit. Never give up."
homer,"That's it! Being abusive to your family is one thing, but I will not stand by and watch you feed a hungry dog! Go to your room."
homer,"Marge : This is terrible! How will the kids get home?  Homer : I dunno. The Internet? [Springfield snow]."
homer,"I want to set the record straight - I thought the cop was a prostitute."
homer,"That's it! If I'm gonna be trapped inside the house I gotta go out and buy some beer."

homer,"Marge! Look at all this great stuff I found at the Marina. It was just sitting in some guy's boat!"
homer,"Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen."

homer,"Shut up, Brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-tip!"
homer,"Remember that postcard Grandpa sent us from Florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom? That's right, we all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman."

homer,"Maybe, just once, someone will call me 'Sir' without adding, 'You're making a scene.'"
homer,"Marge, don't discourage the boy! Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals! Except the weasel."
homer,"Doughnuts. Is there anything they can't do?"
homer,"You know, boys, a nuclear reactor is a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right buttons."
homer,"Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way."
homer,"When will I learn? The answer to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!"
homer,"Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get."

homer,"[Meeting Aliens] Please don't eat me! I have a wife and kids. Eat them!"
homer,"What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts."
homer,"Marge, you're as beautiful as Princess Leia and as smart as Yoda."
homer,"Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try."
homer,"The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother! I call him Gamblor, and it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws!"
homer,"When I look at the smiles on all the children's faces, I just know they're about to jab me with something."
homer,"I'm having the best day of my life, and I owe it all to not going to Church!"
homer,"Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girls sports, such as hot oil wrestling and foxy boxing and such and such."
homer,"I'm not a bad guy! I work hard, and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to Hell?"
homer,"Getting out of jury duty is easy. The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races."
homer,"It's not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day."
homer,"Lisa, Vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and eskimos."
homer,"I want to share something with you: The three little sentences that will get you through life. Number 1: Cover for me. Number 2: Oh, good idea, Boss! Number 3: It was like that when I got here."
homer,"Oh, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. 14% of people know that."
homer,"Remember that postcard Grandpa sent us from Florida of that Alligator biting that woman's bottom? That's right, we all thought it was hilarious. But, it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman."
homer,"Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use."
homer,"How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?"
homer,"Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover."
homer,"Homer no function beer well without."
homer,"I've always wondered if there was a god. And now I know there is--and it's me."
homer,"Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American dream?"
homer,"If something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English."

homer,"I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming."
homer,"[Looking at a globe map...country being Uruguay] Hee hee! Look at this country! 'You-are-gay.'"
homer,"All my life I've had one dream, to achieve my many goals."
homer,"Dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man, and old people are useless."
homer,"But Marge, what if we chose the wrong religion? Each week we just make God madder and madder."
homer,"I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone says they have to work a lot harder when I'm around."
homer,"Dear Lord.. The gods have been good to me. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is. So here's the deal: You freeze everything the way it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is OK, please give me absolutely no sign. OK, deal."
homer,"That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college!"
homer,"Beer: The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems."
homer,"If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing"
homer,"I'm in no condition to drive...wait! I shouldn't listen to myself, I'm drunk!"
homer,"'To Start Press Any Key'. Where's the ANY key?"
