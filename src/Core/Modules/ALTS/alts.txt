<header2>Basic commands<end>

To show your own alts:
<highlight><tab><symbol>alts<end>

To show alts from other users:
<highlight><tab><symbol>alts 'name'<end>

To add characters as your alts:
<highlight><tab><symbol>alts add 'alt1' 'alt2' 'alt3' ...<end>

To add yourself as an alt of a character:
<highlight><tab><symbol>alts main 'name'<end>

To choose one of your alts to be your new main (you must run this from the character you want to be your new main):
<highlight><tab><symbol>alts setmain<end>

To remove alts from your list:
<highlight><tab><symbol>alts rem 'alt'<end>

<header2>Validation after 'alts main'<end>

Alts added to someone's altlist via <highlight><symbol>alts main<end> are unvalidated.

Unvalidated alts do not <a href='chatcmd:///tell <myname> settings change alts_inherit_admin'>inherit</a> the main character's access level.

In order to confirm an unvalidated alt and share access level with them,
you need to run
<tab><highlight><symbol>altvalidate 'name of the alt'<end> on your main.

<header2>Validation after 'alts add'<end>

If <a href='chatcmd:///tell <myname> settings change alts_require_confirmation'>alts require confirmation</a> is on (default is on), then the
main character who ran <highlight><symbol>alts add<end> is unvalidated.

In order to confirm an unvalidated main and share access level with them,
you need to run
<tab><highlight><symbol>altvalidate 'name of the main'<end> on your alt.

But don't worry, once you logon with the alt, you should automatically receive
a request from the bot to confirm or decline your main.
