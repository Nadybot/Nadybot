<header2>Permission set mappings<end>

Permission set mappings tell the bot which permission set to use when
receiving commands from a command source.
They also describe which symbol a message has to start with, in order
to be treated as a command, along with some other flags.

To show a list of the current permission set mappings:
<highlight><tab><symbol>cmdmap<end>

To show a list of all command sources:
<highlight><tab><symbol>cmdmap list src<end>

To map commands from a source to a permission set:
<highlight><tab><symbol>cmdmap create 'source' 'permission set'<end>

To delete a permission set mapping:
<highlight><tab><symbol>cmdmap rem 'source'<end>

To change the symbol for a command source:
<highlight><tab><symbol>cmdmap symbol pick 'source'<end>

To change the permission set to use for a command source:
<highlight><tab><symbol>cmdmap permset pick 'source'<end>

To change if the symbol is optional to start a command:
<highlight><tab><symbol>cmdmap symbolopt set 'source' 'yes/no'<end>

To change whether to give "unknown command" feedback:
<highlight><tab><symbol>cmdmap feedback set 'source' 'yes/no'<end>
