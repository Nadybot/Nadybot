<header2>Permission sets<end>

Permission sets describe which commands should be enabled or disabled,
but also which access level is required to execute each command.
Since you might want to have different permissions for commands via tells
and the guild channel, or you want to disable certain commands in the
private channel, you might want to use more than just one permission set.

By default there are 3 pre-defined permission sets: msg, priv and guild.
Each permission set has a name and a letter. The letter is used to show
if a command is enabled/disable for a permission set in the <symbol>config
command.

To show a list of the current permission sets:
<highlight><tab><symbol>permset<end>

To create a new permission set with default permissions:
<highlight><tab><symbol>permset create 'name' 'letter'<end>

To create a new permission set based on another permission set:
<highlight><tab><symbol>permset clone 'to clone' into 'name' 'letter'<end>

To delete a permission set that is not used:
<highlight><tab><symbol>permset remove 'name'<end>

To rename a permission set:
<highlight><tab><symbol>permset rename 'old name' to 'new name'<end>

To change a permission set's letter:
<highlight><tab><symbol>permset letter 'name' 'new letter'<end>
